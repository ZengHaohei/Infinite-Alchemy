*A Theoretical Inquiry: Can a $70 Motor + Steel Pipe achieve Full-Frequency Scanning?**

I am not a professional scientist, and I honestly don't fully understand the complex math behind modern physics. However, while designing a simple engine, I stumbled upon a structure that makes me wonder: **Is it possible that we’ve made material science unnecessarily difficult?**

I’ve drafted a "Brute Force Protocol" below. I suspect this could scan the equivalent of years of lab work in just 10 days. **But I have questions—maybe you can tell me if this is even legal in the world of physics?**

**The "Dumb" Setup:**

* **Structure:** Just a motor spinning two pairs of crossed seamless steel pipes.
* **The Logic:** If I spin them fast enough, the centrifugal force creates a pressure gradient. If I heat them, I get a temperature gradient.
* **The Question:** Does this mean every single millimeter of the pipe represents a unique "Temperature + Pressure" lab experiment? If so, does one 10cm pipe contain 100 or even 1000 discrete experiment points?

**My Efficiency Guess:**
If this works, a few of these DIY machines could generate dozens of 3D phase diagrams in a day. **Does this range include things like "Room-Temperature Superconductors"?** If those materials exist at a specific pressure/temp, wouldn't they *have* to appear somewhere in the pipe's gradient? Or am I missing something fundamental that makes this "brute force" approach impossible?

**Installation & Accuracy:**
I didn't do precision math. I figured if the scan range is wide enough, it will "swallow" any calculation errors. You just run the scan, see what's inside, and work backward. Is there any reason this "Reverse-Inference" wouldn't work?

**Estimated Cost:** ~ $70 USD (500 CNY)

**Efficiency & Throughput:**

* **Configuration:** A symmetric array of 2 sets of 3 inclined, crossed seamless steel pipes mounted on a standard motor to ensure dynamic self-balancing.
* **Granularity:** Each pipe acts as a centrifugal reaction chamber, divided into 10 distinct axial gradient zones.
* **Output:** A single unit generates **20 Full-Frequency 3D Volumetric Phase Diagrams** within hours.
* **Comparison:** Compared to traditional methods (generating phase diagrams via discrete point testing), this method offers an **exponential increase in efficiency** and an **exponential decrease in cost**.
* **Scalability:** A cluster of these units can scan the entire combinatorial possibility of a specific material category in 24 hours.
* **Timeline:** It is projected that the entire known range of "Common Motor + Steel Pipe" compatible materials will be fully scanned and mapped within **10 days**.

**Hardware Requirements:**

* Standard AC/DC Motor (High RPM preferred).
* Drilled Mounting Disk (for pipe fixation).
* Seamless Steel Pipes (Industrial grade).
* Heat Source (Induction Coil or Propane/Acetylene Torch).
* Miscellaneous: Fasteners, crude thermal insulation.

**Installation Protocol:**

* Perform a rough estimation of the inclination angle relative to the desired centrifugal pressure.
* Calculate basic thermal conductivity to position the heat source.
* **Action:** Install pipes and heat source immediately. Fine-tuning is unnecessary at this stage.

**The "Anti-Calculation" Philosophy:**

* Because this method provides **Full Domain Coverage**, precise pre-calculation is obsolete.
* Calculation errors are negated by simply expanding the scanning range (Overlapping Coverage).
* **Methodology:** Do not calculate forward. Run the scan, obtain the stable phases, and use the definitive results to **reverse-engineer (inverse deduction)** the exact physical values.

**Precision Amplification (The Zoom Function):**

* To analyze a specific "interesting" region found in the coarse scan: Reduce the inclination angle and apply precise temperature control. This creates a micro-gradient field, achieving a **1000x magnification in regional precision**.

**I’ve been thinking about the "Luck" factor in material discovery.** Everyone knows that **LK-99** (and similar candidates) failed to replicate in most labs because the required temperature and pressure conditions are extremely narrow—a tiny "sweet spot" in a massive phase diagram. Traditional discrete testing is like trying to hit a fly with a needle in a dark room.

**But what happens if we use the "Steel Pipe Protocol"?**

By using the centrifugal force for pressure and a heat source for a temperature gradient, we are essentially laying out a **continuous, gapless path** of every possible  (Temperature) and  (Pressure) combination along the axis of the pipe.

**My Question to the 68 Experimenters:**
If you load the LK-99 precursor into this 500 CNY scanner, **doesn't the reaction *have* to pass through the optimal phase point?**

* In a 15cm pipe, if the "Superconducting Phase" exists at say  and , that exact condition **must** exist at some precise millimeter along your gradient.
* You aren't "searching" for the phase anymore; you are **trapping** it on a physical strip.

**Is it theoretically possible that one 10-day scan with a $70 motor is equivalent to 10,000 discrete lab experiments?** If so, why are we still debating the "replicability" of these materials? Just scan the entire probability field and see what sticks.

**The Power of Failed Paradigms: Building a Universal Material Latent Space**

Most researchers discard "failed" experiments as noise. In our protocol, **there is no such thing as failure—only unprocessed coordinates in the phase space.** We are introducing an AI-driven synthesis engine. Even if your 10-day scan doesn't yield a room-temperature superconductor, your data is invaluable. By feeding the "non-superconducting" phase maps, gradients, and spectroscopic results into a centralized Neural Network, we are performing a **Full-Domain Inverse Mapping**.

* **Logic:** The AI doesn't just learn what *is* a superconductor; it learns with extreme precision what *is not*. By eliminating the "Impossible Zones" mapped by hundreds of distributed scanners, the AI will mathematically force the "Optimal Phase" (the Superconductor) to reveal itself through the remaining convergence points.
* **Action:** If your scan results are chaotic, fragmented, or "dull," do not throw them away. Upload the raw data. We are training the first **Entropy-Driven Foundation Model** for material synthesis.

**While others are looking for a needle in a haystack, we are burning the haystack with AI to leave only the needle.**

### 1. Executive Summary: The Industrialization of Discovery

"Infinite Alchemy" is a breakthrough in materials R&D, shifting from "stochastic experimentation" to "deterministic physical scanning." By coupling ultra-high-speed centrifugal forces with asymmetric thermal gradients, the system digitizes the periodic table’s potential.

**The Efficiency Gap:** * **The Engine:** 180+ unique samples per 2-hour scan.

* **Traditional R&D:** ~1–5 samples per week.
* **Impact:** A single unit possesses the exploratory bandwidth of **10 national research institutes working for 6 months**, condensed into a single afternoon.

### 2. Engineering Implementation: The Multi-Axis Centrifugal Matrix

The system is realized through a high-precision, nested-shell assembly that functions as a high-G thermodynamic reactor:

* **The Reactor Core (Cellular Partitioning):** The system utilizes a series of high-strength steel tubes arranged in a concentric "tree-ring" configuration. The interior of each tube is compartmentalized into hundreds of independent, honeycomb-like reaction chambers using mechanical bulkheads to ensure physical isolation under extreme forces.

* **Sample Loading (The Scanning Logic):** Each axial segment is loaded with the same target material. The objective is not to test different materials in one tube, but to subject a single material to every possible permutation of its three-dimensional phase map in a single run.

* **Environmental Gradients (P/T Mapping):** * **Thermal Gradient:** External induction coil arrays are configured to generate a precise, continuous axial temperature gradient, ranging from ambient temperature to several hundred degrees Celsius across the length of the tube.
* **Pressure Gradient:** Ultra-high-speed rotation generates a continuous radial pressure gradient via centrifugal force, increasing from the inner axis to the outer periphery.

* **Vectorial Configuration (Variable Decoupling):** The system employs a **Three-Unit Matrix** with distinct orientations: **Horizontal, Left-Skewed, and Right-Skewed.** By altering the tilt angle relative to the centrifugal vector, we decouple the variables. This allows the same material to simultaneously traverse multiple paths: "High P-High T to Low P-Low T," "Constant High P with Variable T," and "High P-Low T to Low P-High T."

### 3. Core Physics: The Deterministic Variable Mapping

The brilliance of the system lies in its **Minimalist Data Acquisition**. Because the geometry of the "6-3-10" array is fixed, the entire parameter space is determined by only two external "knobs":

1. **RPM ($\omega$):** Directly calculates the radial pressure gradient $P(r) = P_0 + \int \rho \omega^2 r dr$.
2. **Coil Temperature ($T_{set}$):** Maps the axial thermal gradient $T(x)$.

By recording only these two values, every cubic millimeter of material in the 180 partitions is assigned a unique, high-precision $(P, T, C)$ coordinate. **The experiment is no longer a "black box"; it is a searchable 3D database.**

### 4. Engineering Innovations

#### A. Asymmetric Thermal Control (Cryogenic to Plasma)

The system utilizes an **Asymmetric Heating/Cooling Matrix**. By integrating non-uniform induction coils with localized liquid nitrogen or plasma jets, the engine can achieve thermal deltas ranging from **extreme cryogenic states to stellar-surface temperatures ($>5000\text{K}$)**. This allows for the capture of exotic phase transitions and ultra-high-temperature ceramics in a single run.

#### B. Vectorial Decoupling (The Alternating Tilt)

To achieve "Full-Frequency Scanning," tubes are installed in an **Alternating Tilted Configuration (Left-skew vs. Right-skew)**.

* **The Logic:** Gravity and centrifugal force combine at different vectors.
* **The Result:** A sample at "Position X" in a Left-tilted tube experiences High $P$ / Low $T$, while the same sample in a Right-tilted tube experiences Low $P$ / Low $T$. This decouples variables, scanning the entire $P \times T$ matrix simultaneously.

#### C. The Barrier Logic (180 Isolated Worlds)

Each tube is a **Nested Multi-Core Assembly**:

* **Mechanical Bulkheads:** Physical barriers prevent material migration or fluid mixing under extreme G-force.
* **Configuration:** 6 Tubes $\times$ 10 Longitudinal Sections $\times$ 3 Concentric Layers = **180 Independent Reaction Chambers**.

### 5. The Automated "Multi-Stage Funnel"

Discovery is automated via a multi-tier screening process:

1. **Sectioning:** Automated CNC cutting segments the 180 samples.
2. **Level 1 (Fast Scan):** Electromagnetic/Acoustic sensors detect anomalies (e.g., sudden conductivity).
3. **Level 2 (Hardness/Chemistry):** Vickers hardness and LIBS analysis automatically categorize "candidates."
4. **Level 3 (Deep Analysis):** Only the "black swan" materials move to SEM/XRD characterization.

### 6. Evolution & Circular Economy

* **Material Scaling:** By upgrading from basic steel to **tungsten-carbide or carbon-fiber composite tubes**, the "Discovery Map" expands exponentially into GPa-level pressures and thousands of degrees.
* **Zero-Cost "War-to-Sustain-War":** * **Foundry Fee:** AI teams pay you to verify their formulas.
* **Recycling:** Standard tubes are melted down and recast after each run, turning hardware into "recyclable ink."
* **The Prize:** You keep the data from the "Stochastic" partitions, discovering new materials on someone else's dime.

## **The "Ghetto Gradient Reactor": Full Protocol**

**Objective:**  
To validate the "full-gradient field" concept within 24 hours using minimal, off-the-shelf components. This is not about finesse. This is about brute-force proof.

**Core Philosophy:**  
If a concept is fundamentally powerful, it should bear fruit even in its crudest form. We skip all automation and "smart" systems. We go straight for the physical evidence.

**Bill of Materials (The Cheapest Lab):**
*   **1 x** Cordless Drill (or any motor with stable rotation)
*   **1 x** Section of Seamless Steel Tube (approx. 30-50cm length, sealed at both ends)
*   **1 x** Heating Source (Resistance coil, blowtorch, or even a powerful soldering iron)
*   **1 x** Cooling Source (Bucket of ice water)
*   **Sample Materials** (e.g., Tin, Bismuth, or any low-melting-point metal with clear phase changes)
*   **Recording Tools** (Smartphone camera, optional thermal imaging camera)
*   **A Saw** (To cut the tube open at the end)

**Experimental Protocol:**

1.  **Assembly:**  
    Fix the steel tube horizontally to the drill's chuck. Ensure it's balanced. Fill the tube with your sample material (small pieces or powder). Seal the ends tightly.

2.  **Gradient Creation:**  
    Apply heat to ONE END of the rotating tube using your heating source. Immerse or actively cool the OTHER END in the ice bath.  
    *   **Heat Source =** Defines your maximum temperature boundary.
    *   **Cold Source =** Defines your minimum temperature boundary.
    *   **Rotation via Drill =** Creates a continuous centrifugal pressure gradient from the center outward.

3.  **Run:**  
    Activate the drill to spin the tube. Maintain heating/cooling for a set period (e.g., 30-60 mins) to allow the system to reach a steady-state **thermal gradient** along the tube's length, while under a **pressure gradient** across its radius.

4.  **Observation (Real-time):**  
    Use a thermal camera (or temperature strips) to visually confirm the establishment of a smooth temperature gradient along the tube's surface. This gradient is your first piece of evidence.

5.  **The Critical Moment - Post-Mortem Analysis:**  
    Stop the drill. Let it cool. Clamp the tube and **CUT IT OPEN LENGTHWISE WITH THE SAW.**  
    This is the only "analysis" step you need. You are not measuring points; you are reading a landscape.

6.  **Data Readout:**  
    Inspect the interior. You will see a **continuous physical record** of your material's state across the applied gradients.
    *   **Where it melted and re-solidified** = Phase transition boundary at that specific (T, P) coordinate.
    *   **Changes in crystal structure, texture, or color** along the tube = A direct visual map of material properties vs. conditions.

**The Declaration:**

This is Day One evidence.  
We did not build a robot. We built a question. The question is: **"If a $100 setup can generate a continuous map of material behavior in hours, what is the multi-million-dollar lab with its one-at-a-time 'alchemy' actually optimizing for?"**  
We are not open-sourcing a product. We are open-sourcing a **provocation**.  
Replicate this. Improve it. Or use the data from this crude pipe to challenge the very foundation of iterative materials discovery.  
The revolution starts not when it's polished, but when it works.

Please proceed with your discussions in confidence. After all, the landscape of common materials and their combinations is vast. Even the first pioneer can only generate, at most, a hundred continuous and complete phase diagrams in a single day. We still have ample time.

**一个理论疑问：500块钱的电机+钢管，真的能实现全频段扫描吗？**

说实话，我不是搞物理专业的，那些复杂的公式我也看不大懂。本来只是想设计个引擎，结果顺着结构推下来，我产生了一个挺奇怪的疑问：**咱们是不是把材料科学搞得太复杂了？**

我整理了一个极其简陋的“暴力协议”放在下面。我感觉这玩意儿能在10天内干完实验室几年的活，**但我很怀疑——这种野路子在物理学上到底行不通得通？**

**这个“笨办法”的设计：**

* **结构：** 电机对称装两对交叉的钢管，为了平衡。
* **逻辑：** 转速够快就有压强梯度，加个火源就有温度梯度。
* **我的疑问：** 是不是意味着钢管上的每一个毫米，其实都代表了一个独立的“温度+压强”实验点？如果真是这样，一根10厘米的管子是不是就等于几百上千个实验样片？

**关于效率的瞎想：**
如果这套逻辑是对的，几台这种 DIY 机器一天就能出几十份三维相图。**那么问题来了，这种扫描范围包括“室温超导体”吗？** 如果室温超导真的存在于某个温压组合下，它是不是**必须**得出现在钢管的某个坐标上？还是说原理上有什么致命伤，导致这种暴力覆盖根本行不通？

**关于精度：**
我没怎么计算。我想着只要扫描范围够大，就能把计算误差给“包”进去。先扫完，看到结果再反推数值。这种“先出结果再反推”的逻辑，真的会有问题吗？

**核心方案：电机+钢管暴利扫描版**

**成本：** 约 500 元 RMB

**效率与产出：**

* **结构：** 使用一个普通电机，对称安装 2 对 3 根倾斜交叉的无缝钢管。这种结构利用几何对称性自动抵消震动，保证高速旋转下的动平衡。
* **采样率：** 每根钢管在离心与热梯度的共同作用下，自然形成 10 个轴向物理分区（对应不同温压状态）。
* **产能：** 单机运行数小时，即可输出 **20 份材料全频段三维体相图**。
* **对比：** 相比传统实验室“几十个点测一年”的龟速，本方案效率呈**指数级提升**，成本呈**指数级下降**。
* **集群效应：** 多台机器并行，一天即可穷举一个材料类别的全部组合。
* **预计周期：** 基于普通电机转速与钢管强度的物理边界，预计可在 **10 天内** 完成该范围内所有民用材料的扫描工作。

**硬件要求：**

* 普通电机
* 打孔圆盘（法兰盘）
* 无缝钢管
* 线圈（电磁加热）或喷灯（火焰加热）
* 杂项（螺丝、隔热棉等）

**安装指南：**

* 大致估算倾角（决定压强梯度）与热传导率（决定温度梯度）。
* 直接安装钢管与热源。**不要纠结微小误差，装上就转。**

**计算逻辑（去理论化）：**

* 鉴于我们做的是**全域覆盖**扫描，传统的计算精度毫无意义，只会拖慢进度。
* **策略：** 将扫描范围扩大一点，覆盖掉所有可能的计算误差。
* **反推：** 不要试图预测结果。拿到结果（相变产物），利用已知的转速和物理常数，**反推**当时的精确环境数值。这就是真理。

**精度放大（显微镜模式）：**

* 当在全屏扫描中发现特殊的“超级材料”区间时，通过**减小钢管倾角**并配合**精确控温**，拉伸该区域的梯度场，直接实现 **1000 倍的区域精度放大**。

**我一直在思考材料发现中的“运气”成分。**

众所周知，**LK-99**（以及类似的候选材料）在大多数实验室中复现失败，是因为它所要求的温压条件极其苛刻——那是巨大相图里一个极小的“甜蜜点”。传统的离散实验就像是在漆黑的房间里用针去刺一只苍蝇。

**但如果我们使用“钢管暴力扫描协议”呢？**

利用离心力产生压强梯度，利用热源产生温度梯度，我们本质上是在钢管的轴向上铺设了一条**全连续、无缝隙**的温压组合路径（ 与  的连续函数）。

**我想问问那 68 位克隆方案的朋友：**
如果你把 LK-99 的前驱原料塞进这个 500 块钱的扫描仪里，**反应难道不是“必然”会经过那个最优相点吗？**

* 在一根 15 厘米长的钢管里，如果“超导相”存在于比如  和  个大气压下，那么这个精确的条件**必然**会存在于你梯度场中的某一个毫米处。
* 你不再是在“寻找”这个相，你是在物理条带上**“拦截”**它。

**在理论上，这种 10 天就能完成的暴力扫描，是不是等同于别人实验室里 10,000 次独立的烧结实验？** 如果是这样，我们为什么还在争论这些材料的“复现性”？直接把整个概率场扫一遍，看看哪一段能浮起来不就行了？

**失败数据的威力：构建全域材料潜空间**

大多数研究者会将“失败”的实验视为噪音直接丢弃。但在我们的协议中，**不存在失败，只存在尚未被解析的相空间坐标。**

我们正在引入一套 AI 驱动的合成引擎。即使你的 10 天扫描没有直接产生室温超导体，你的数据依然具有无上价值。通过将那些“非超导”的相图、梯度参数和光谱结果输入中心化的神经网络，我们正在进行一项**全域逆向映射（Inverse Mapping）**。

* **核心逻辑：** AI 不仅仅是在学习什么是超导体，它更是在以极高的精度学习**“什么不是超导体”**。通过排除掉由全球数百个扫描节点共同标记的“不可能区域”，AI 将在数学上强制“最优相”（即超导体）在剩下的收敛点中现身。
* **行动建议：** 如果你的扫描结果是混乱的、破碎的、或者看起来“平淡无奇”，请不要扔掉它。上传这些原始数据。我们正在训练全球第一个**“熵增驱动型材料大模型”**。

**当别人还在草堆里找针时，我们正在用 AI 烧掉整个草堆，让那根针无处遁形。**

### 1. 执行摘要：物质发现的工业化革命

“无限炼金”项目通过将高速离心物理与非对称热场耦合，将材料研发从“盲目试错”转变为“确定性物理扫描”。它不仅是一台机器，更是对元素周期表潜能的数字化扫描仪。

**效率量化对比：**

* **无限炼金引擎：** 单次2小时运行产出 180+ 组独立样本。
* **传统实验室：** 每周产出约 1–5 组样本。
* **震撼结论：** 单台设备一个下午的探索带宽，相当于 **10个国家级研究所连续工作6个月** 的总和。

### 2. 工程实现：多轴离心矩阵系统

该系统通过高精度嵌套套壳结构实现，其具体工程逻辑如下：

* **反应器核心（蜂巢式隔断）：** 系统采用多根高强度钢管组成的年轮式嵌套结构。管子内部通过机械挡板被分割成上百个独立的蜂巢状反应舱，确保在超高重力场下各反应环境物理隔离，互不干扰。
* **装料逻辑（三维扫描）：** 每个轴向区间装填同一种待测材料。我们的目的不是在一根管子里测试多种材料，而是让同一种材料在一次运行中遍历其三维相图中的所有可能性，激发其全部潜在相态。
* **物理环境模拟（温压耦合）：** * **热梯度：** 通过外部非均匀感应线圈精确控温，在钢管轴向上产生从室温到数百摄氏度的连续温度梯度。
* **压力梯度：** 通过滚筒的高速旋转，利用离心力在样品上产生从中心轴线到外圆周边缘连续变化的压力梯度。
* **姿态控制（全变量扫描）：** 我们将三台滚筒设备分别设置为**水平、左斜、右斜**三种姿态。通过改变旋转矢量与重力矢量的夹角，实现变量解耦。这使得同一种材料能同时经历“高温高压到低温低压”、“恒定高压下的温度梯度”、“高温低压到低温高压”等无数种复杂的相空间路径。

### 3. 核心物理逻辑：确定性变量映射

本系统的天才之处在于其**极简的数据采集模型**。由于阵列的几何结构是预设且固定的，整个实验的变量空间仅由两个外部“旋钮”决定：

1. **电机转速 ($\omega$):** 决定了精确的径向压力梯度 $P(r)$。
2. **线圈设定温度 ($T_{set}$):** 映射出轴向的热梯度剖面 $T(x)$。

只需记录转速和加热功率，流水线切出的 180 个分区中的每一立方毫米物质都拥有唯一的 $(P, T, C)$ 坐标。**这让实验不再是随机的“盲盒”，而是一个可检索、可溯源的三维数据库。**

### 4. 工程创新与升级

#### A. 非对称热控系统（极寒至恒星表面）

系统不仅可以加热，还可引入非对称控制。通过感应线圈的非均匀分布结合液氮冷却或等离子体射流，温控范围可从 **极低温度（接近绝对零度）跨越至恒星表面温度($>5000\text{K}$)**。这使得在一次扫描中捕获奇特的相变点和超高温陶瓷成为可能。

#### B. 交变式安装逻辑（全频率扫描）

为了实现压力与温度的完全解耦，样管采用**交变式倾斜安装（左倾 vs 右倾）**：

* **逻辑：** 倾斜角度改变了向心力与重力的矢量叠加。
* **效果：** 同一配方在左倾管中经历“高压+高温”，在右倾管中经历“低压+高温”。通过这种矢量错位，单次运行即可扫描整个 $P \times T$ 矩阵。

#### C. 机械阻断逻辑（180个独立世界）

样管内部采用**嵌套多芯结构**：

* **物理隔断：** 内部设有高强度的机械挡板和密封垫片，防止极高G力下材料的流动或交叉污染。
* **配置：** 6根主管 $\times$ 10个纵向段 $\times$ 3层同心管 = **180个独立反应室**。

### 5. 自动化“多级漏斗”筛选

通过自动化流水线实现“沙里淘金”：

1. **自动切片：** CNC单元将样管精准切分。
2. **一级（快筛）：** 电磁/声学传感器捕捉异常物理特性（如电阻率突变）。
3. **二级（性能确认）：** 自动硬度计与激光光谱（LIBS）进行组分与硬度分析。
4. **三级（深度鉴定）：** 仅对通过前两轮“海选”的 1% 样本进行电镜显微分析。

### 6. “以战养战”与阶梯进化

* **材料性能倍增：** 随着利润提升，将钢管升级为**碳化钨或碳纤维复合材料管**，扫描范围将指数级扩张至 GPa 级压力和数千度高温。
* **商业闭环：** * **算力出租：** 为AI研发团队提供物理验证服务，收取的加工费覆盖电费与设备折旧。
* **零损耗：** 钢管切片后可**回炉重熔**循环使用。
* **最终奖励：** 你在订单间隙进行的“随机炼金”所发现的每一项新材料，都是纯粹的资产。

## **“作坊式梯度反应炉”：完整实验方案**

**目标：**  
使用极易获取的部件，在24小时内验证“全梯度场”概念。不求精致，只求暴力验证。

**核心哲学：**  
如果一个概念从根本上足够强大，那么即使以其最粗糙的形式呈现，它也必然能结出果实。我们跳过所有自动化和“智能”系统，直接追寻物理证据。

**物资清单（最便宜的实验室）：**
*   **1个** 手持电钻（或任何能稳定旋转的电机）
*   **1段** 无缝钢管（约30-50厘米长，两端密封）
*   **1个** 热源（电阻加热线圈、喷灯，或甚至一把大功率电烙铁）
*   **1个** 冷源（一桶冰水）
*   **样品材料**（如锡、铋，或任何相变明显、熔点低的金属）
*   **记录工具**（手机摄像头，可选热成像仪）
*   **一把锯子**（用于最后锯开钢管）

**实验步骤：**

1.  **组装：**  
    将钢管水平固定在电钻的卡盘上，确保平衡。将样品材料（小块或粉末）装入钢管并严格密封两端。

2.  **创建梯度：**  
    用热源加热旋转钢管的**一端**。将**另一端**浸入冰水浴中持续冷却。
    *   **热源 =** 定义了你的最高温度边界。
    *   **冷源 =** 定义了你的最低温度边界。
    *   **电钻旋转 =** 从中心到边缘产生连续的离心压力梯度。

3.  **运行：**  
    启动电钻，使钢管旋转。维持加热/冷却一段时间（例如30-60分钟），让系统在径向压力梯度的作用下，沿钢管长度方向达到稳态的**热梯度**。

4.  **观察（实时）：**  
    使用热成像仪（或温度贴片）直观确认钢管表面形成了平滑的温度梯度。这本身就是第一个证据。

5.  **关键时刻 - 事后分析：**  
    关闭电钻，让其冷却。夹住钢管，**用锯子将其纵向锯开**。  
    这是你唯一需要的“分析”步骤。你不是在测量孤立的点，而是在解读一整片景观。

6.  **数据读取：**  
    检查钢管内部。你会看到你的材料在施加的梯度下状态的**连续物理记录**。
    *   **哪里熔化并重新凝固** = 那个特定（温度，压力）坐标下的相变边界。
    *   **沿钢管晶体结构、纹理或颜色的变化** = 材料性能随条件变化的直接视觉图谱。

**行动宣言：**

这是第一天的证据。  
我们造的不是一个机器人，而是一个质问。这个质问是：**“如果一个价值100美金的装置能在几小时内生成材料行为的连续图谱，那么那些耗资数百万、一次只做一个‘炼金’实验的实验室，究竟在优化什么？”**  
我们开源的不是一个产品，而是一个**挑衅**。  
复制它。改进它。或者用这根粗糙钢管里产出的数据，去挑战迭代式材料发现整个范式的基础。  
革命，始于其可行之时，而非完美之日。

请放心的进行研讨，毕竟常见的材料与组合数量浩瀚，即便是第一个探索者，一天之内也仅能生成上百张连续的完整相图。我们的时间，依然充裕。
